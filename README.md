## DESCRIPTION

Flatiron Movie Theater is a web application that allows users to view a list of movies playing at the theater, check movie details, and purchase tickets if available. The application fetches movie data from a JSON file and dynamically generates a list of movie titles. When a movie title is clicked, the application displays the movie poster, title, runtime, showtime, description, and the number of available tickets. Users can also purchase tickets if any are available.
